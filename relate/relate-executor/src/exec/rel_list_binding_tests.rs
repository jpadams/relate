//! LABS-811 item 3: the var-length rel binding is modeled — the
//! rel-list spelling of the walk vocabulary ([`crate::pattern_walk`]'s
//! `RelListBinding`/`rel_list_binding`), the `Binding<Vec<RelId>>` form
//! of the classification every other pattern element already reads — and
//! the two classic engines reconcile a pre-bound trail through it
//! instead of each hand-rolling its own policy over the same value.
//!
//! The pins, one graph (a four-node `R` chain, so one- and two-hop
//! trails coexist):
//!
//! - **The exact-trail rule, both engines** — a pre-bound relationship
//!   list pins the trail (LABS-661, the statement engine's GPM
//!   `Prebound` policy; `overlay::tests::bound_rel_list_is_exact_trail`
//!   pins it at statement level). The eval walk (pattern comprehensions,
//!   pattern predicates, expression shortest paths — the compact `rels`
//!   view) used to overwrite the pre-bound list without reconciling, so
//!   a comprehension enumerated freely past a row-bound trail: these
//!   pins hold both engines to the one rule.
//! - **A malformed list matches nothing** — a list holding a
//!   non-relationship element is a `Mismatch`, the same predicate as
//!   every other spelling of the vocabulary, not an unbound variable
//!   the walk silently rebinds.
//! - **A null pre-binding matches nothing in the eval walk** — the
//!   classic family's own rule (the Neo4j-verified single-hop behavior,
//!   LABS-711; the family's pin
//!   `gpm::gpm_tests::a_null_prebound_rel_variable_is_not_rebound_by_the_classic_walker`
//!   documents it and the GPM engine's deliberate, ticketed divergence
//!   from it — ADR-0335's null-is-fresh arm, which this change does not
//!   touch). The eval walk's var-length arm used to rebind a null
//!   pre-binding freely; it now answers the family's zero rows.
