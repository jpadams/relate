//! Aggregation in the expression positions that cannot aggregate.
//!
//! Neo4j rejects an aggregate in a list/map comprehension projection or
//! filter, a quantifier predicate, a `reduce()` step expression, an `UNWIND`
//! source, or a CIP-135 `WHEN` predicate at compile time (42I24 under top-
//! level 42001 — an `InvalidAggregation`/`SyntaxError` here). Relate used
//! to let several of them reach the executor's scalar-eval backstop, which
//! both mis-classified the error and (before that backstop ran) could matter
//! for error precedence; the SemanticErrorPart2 "aggregation inside looping
//! expressions" battery pins the class.
//!
//! The iteration *source* of a comprehension/quantifier/`reduce()` is
//! aggregation-transparent (`all(x IN collect(l) WHERE x > 0)` is legal,
//! live-verified); only the per-element expression/predicate is checked.
//!
//! Two entry points, one policy, each covering a distinct position class:
//!
//! - [`validate_expression_slots`] judges ONE expression node; the
//!   whole-tree walk's expression visitor calls it for every node of the
//!   statement at every depth, so every clause's expressions (CREATE/MERGE
//!   property maps, SET values, DELETE/REMOVE targets, CALL arguments, …) are
//!   covered without a second clause enumeration here.
//! - [`validate_clause_slots`] owns the two *clause-level*
//!   slots — an `UNWIND` source and a CIP-135 `WHEN` predicate — which are
//!   not expression-node slots, so the expression visitor cannot see them.
//!
//! The reject test is [`contains_aggregation_anywhere`] (the full reach), so
//! an aggregate nested in an `IN` operand, a literal, a `CASE` arm or a
//! dynamic key is found too.
