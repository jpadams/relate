//! LABS-646 pins: the two correctness surprises the PathDB corpus spike
//! (2026-11-01) characterized while translating the 142 RPQs. Both are
//! pinned as behavior tests so neither can change silently — and so the
//! corpus's recorded row counts stay explainable.
//!
//! 1. `count(p)` over a **fixed-length** path pattern raises
//!    `UndefinedVariable: variable 'p' not defined`, while the same
//!    aggregation over a var-length spelling of the identical language
//!    (`*1..1`) and `count(*)` both work. The bound path variable of a
//!    fixed-length pattern is not visible to the aggregate. This is a
//!    known engine defect characterized by the spike and carried by
//!    LABS-646 (the corpus queries spell their aggregations around it);
//!    fixing it must flip this pin — the assertion below deliberately
//!    fails when the variable becomes defined.
//! 2. Per-branch `LIMIT` in a `UNION` composes additively: each branch
//!    caps its own rows, the union keeps distinct rows, so two branches
//!    capped at 100 can legitimately answer 115 — past the single cap
//!    the PathDB originals had. The PathDB translation of `(A? | B)`
//!    (one RPQ, one cap) becomes two LIMIT-capped branches, and its row
//!    counts reflect that. The engine is Cypher-correct here; the pin
//!    records the semantics the corpus's UNION spellings rely on.
