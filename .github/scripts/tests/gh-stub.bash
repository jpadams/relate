# Hermetic gh stub writer for the .github/scripts bats suites.
#
# bats-loadable: `load gh-stub` from a .bats file in this directory.
# write_gh_stub writes a gh stub executable that never touches the
# network; the caller supplies the per-subcommand success handlers as
# case arms on stdin (a quoted heredoc keeps them verbatim):
#
#   write_gh_stub "${STUBS_DIR}/gh" <<'ARMS'
#   "release list")
#     cat "${GH_STUB_RELEASES:?GH_STUB_RELEASES not set}"
#     ;;
#   ARMS
#
# The writer owns the harness around the arms, so every suite's stub
# agrees on it: each invocation appends its argv (one line per call) to
# $GH_STUB_LOG — assert calls with `grep -c '^release list '
# "${GH_STUB_LOG}"`; every arm gets a GH_STUB_FAIL=<subcommand> guard
# that fails that one subcommand loudly (the subcommand name is read
# off the arm's pattern); and an invocation matching no arm fails with
# "unexpected invocation". The caller exports GH_STUB_LOG and any
# GH_STUB_* inputs its arms read (e.g. GH_STUB_RELEASES) before running
# the script under test with the stub's directory on PATH.
