"""Drift guard for the stellar-prep LAST-fetch (LABS-844): the ledger's
last_head is fetched with --depth=1 ONLY when the commit is missing
locally. On a shallow clone, an unconditional --depth=1 fetch of an
already-present LAST rewrites the shallow boundary and can sever the
commit from parents the repo already has — observed live in CI (the
merge-base resolved during input derivation, then incremental.py got
no-common-ancestor and the anchoring patch degraded to empty). The
present-locally guard (`git cat-file -e "$LAST^{commit}"`) must live in
ONE helper every mode routes through — a second forked spelling of the
fetch, or a call site that fetches before checking, reopens the bug."""
