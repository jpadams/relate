  "The crash/pause nemeses for the containerized DB node: the v1 kill
  lane (LABS-650), the widened schedules (LABS-651 — pause, SIGTERM,
  mid-checkpoint), and the lazyfs power-off (LABS-654).

  The stock relate-bolt image is scratch-based and its entrypoint
  execs into `relate serve` — PID 1, no shell, no process table to
  grep, no `kill`. The faithful faults at this packaging:

  - kill -9  `docker kill` — process death without the final checkpoint;
             the flock writer lease is kernel-released, so the store is
             retakeable. Recovery: `docker start`, the WAL replay.
  - SIGTERM  `docker kill --signal SIGTERM` — PID 1 IS serve (the exec),
             so the signal reaches serve's own handler: clean shutdown
             with a final checkpoint, exit 0, the 'serve: shutting down'
             line on stderr (cumulative logs: only the suffix since the
             signal counts). Recovery: `docker start`.
  - pause    `docker pause` — the cgroup freezer freezes every process;
             serve stays alive mid-whatever, still holding the
             .cypherlite.writer flock (the freezer does not release file
             locks). Recovery: `docker unpause`, the thaw.
  - poweroff the lazyfs rig (docker-compose.lazyfs.yml, LABS-654): the
             store sits on a lazyfs FUSE mount INSIDE the container,
             whose backing root lives on the /data volume. The power-off
             is the verified recipe: the clear-cache fault (drop every
             un-fsynced byte lazyfs holds in memory) over the fault
             FIFO, then docker kill — SIGKILL takes serve AND lazyfs
             down together, so nothing further can be flushed; only the
             fsynced bytes in the backing root survive. docker start
             remounts lazyfs and WAL replay recovers exactly those. In
             full durability mode the WAL fsync happens BEFORE the
             commit ack, so the lane proves precisely that boundary.

  These nemeses do not trust their own green. jepsen 0.3.12-0.3.14's
  grepkill! made kill nemeses silent no-ops for three releases — the
  lesson generalizes: fault machinery that reports success without
  observing the fault is worthless. Every fault is VERIFIED from the
  client side and the evidence rides the nemesis op's :value into the
  history, where the fault-evidence checker fails the whole run unless
  every requested fault fired and every recovery came back:

  - :start (the crash) must leave State.Running=false, exit code 137
    (the SIGKILL signature), AND a probe on the lane's wire that cannot
    connect. For the poweroff lane the clear-cache fault must ALSO have
    been delivered first — a power-off without the cache clear is a
    plain kill and certifies nothing about un-fsynced bytes. Its
    evidence carries :killed-at — the kill instant on the history clock
    (jepsen.util/relative-time-nanos, the same clock op :times use),
    captured immediately before docker kill; the relaxed lanes' bound
    checkers need WHEN each kill landed relative to the acks.
  - a SIGTERM must let the process exit BY ITSELF within the deadline,
    exit code 0, the 'serve: shutting down' line NEW in the stderr
    suffix.
  - a pause must leave State.Paused=true AND a wire probe that cannot
    connect (bounded at the driver's connection timeout — the kernel
    completes the TCP handshake into the frozen backlog, so it never
    hangs). While the writer is frozen with the lock held, the flock
    pin runs: a SECOND serve against the same /data store must be
    rejected with the storage-locked error (ADR-0097) — a freezer that
    released the lease, or a serve that opened a locked store, fails
    the run.
  - :stop (the recovery) must bring the container back AND pass the
    lane's probe with the pinned identity — restart liveness, the
    flock-release invariant (ADR-0077): a restarted serve must retake
    the store and open cleanly, within restart-timeout-secs."
