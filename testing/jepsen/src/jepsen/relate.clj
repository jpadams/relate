  "Jepsen harness for Relate: a single-node (n=1) dockerized test
  program, ONE dispatcher for every lane — the set-workload crash lanes
  (LABS-650's v1 kill lane, widened by LABS-651 to pause, SIGTERM, and
  mid-checkpoint schedules), the mode-aware durability lanes (LABS-653,
  the crash-recovery matrix ADR-0470 unblocked), one lane per surface
  (Bolt v1; LABS-655's HTTP), the Elle transactional lanes (LABS-652),
  the LazyFS power-off lane (LABS-654), and the Neo4j-differential
  compare workload (LABS-657).

  Topology: this control container (JVM 21, Clojure CLI, the harness)
  plus one DB node — the stock product image (`make docker`) running
  `relate serve` on a persistent /data volume with preset auth and
  `--bolt-identity Neo4j/5.26.0` (LABS-649: the official driver refuses
  any agent not starting Neo4j/); the image's entrypoint appends the
  HTTP Query API v2 port (7474) itself. docker-compose.yml owns both;
  the mounted docker socket is the control plane (the scratch image
  offers no SSH and no shell), and each lane's wire is the data plane.

  Workloads (--workload):

  - set (v1, default): the set family — 5+ concurrent clients CREATE
    nodes with unique user-visible `id`s through explicit transactions
    (ack = COMMIT SUCCESS; the http surface's auto-commit equivalent
    acks on the consumed 200 envelope) under the --nemesis fault
    schedule. Which final-state contract the run is checked against is
    the durability LANE (--lane):

      full         acked ⊆ recovered ⊆ attempted, verbatim (v1). The
                   every-green evidence is a pair of consecutive green
                   runs, the second on the non-virgin data volume.
      everysecond  ADR-0077's bound: acked writes acknowledged within
                   ~1s before a kill may be lost; older acks must
                   survive.
      snapshot     ADR-0077's bound at checkpoint granularity: acks
                   since the last completed checkpoint (bounded by the
                   checkpoint interval) may be lost; older must
                   survive.
      memory-vfs   the negative control: the same workload and fault
                   against a Memory VFS store (no durable medium) must
                   LOSE acked writes — the calibration that the fault
                   bites, recorded before any full-mode green is
                   counted.

    The lane reaches the DB through compose env
    (RELATE_DURABILITY_MODE, RELATE_DATABASE,
    RELATE_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_SECS — run.sh exports them) and the
    harness asserts at setup that the container really runs them
    (db.clj's config guard) and that the image's binary really reads
    the mode variable (db.clj's ADR-0470 wiring probe).

  - counter / bank (LABS-652): the Elle transactional lanes — 5+
    concurrent clients, 5+ minute runs, isolation under concurrency
    with NO faults by default (the MySQL 8.0.34 precedent), checked by
    the curated anomaly set: elle.list-append (counter) /
    elle.rw-register (bank) under [:snapshot-isolation
    :strong-session-snapshot-isolation] — the G2/write-skew whitelist
    (ADR-0015/0028) — plus the [:serializable] gate (SI ≡ serializable
    by workload shape: every transaction reads everything it writes),
    plus [:strict-serializable] as discovery only. The bank lane is
    additionally checked by jepsen's bank checker (conservation,
    non-negativity). Both lanes optionally run under the kill cycle
    (--nemesis kill).

  - compare (LABS-657): the Neo4j-differential workload — a random
    graph and op generator over the shared openCypher floor, executed
    against BOTH Relate and a real-Neo4j reference container, each
    divergence shrunk to a minimal Cypher case. On demand only, never
    per-PR; compare.clj builds the whole test itself.

  Surfaces (--surface, set family): bolt (v1) and http (LABS-655) —
  the HTTP Query API v2 spoken raw, no official Java-driver version
  has a Query API transport (see http_client.clj for the
  verification). The http surface runs the set workload (auto-commit
  CREATE) AND the register workload (auto-commit last-write-wins SET
  on one durable register; the final value must be a plausible write
  and never a ghost or a rejected write), with every fault verified on
  the HTTP wire.

  Faults (--nemesis): the set family reads the SCHEDULE vocabulary —
  kill9 (docker kill / docker start), pause (the cgroup freezer plus
  the flock pin), sigterm-kill9 (clean shutdown interleaved with
  crashes), mid-checkpoint (kills jittered over a 5s checkpoint
  period, with rotation evidence) — schedule.clj is the one table —
  plus poweroff (LABS-654: the lazyfs rig's clear-cache fault + docker
  kill, a faithful whole-machine power-off that tests the fsync claim
  itself; run-poweroff.sh drives it — under it --lane names only the
  lazyfs container's durability mode, the check is always the full
  contract, and the setup guard asserts the lazyfs store path). The
  Elle lanes read their own
  kill|none toggle instead. fault-plan is the one reconciliation of
  the vocabulary with the workload — each family interprets the word
  and rejects the other family's spellings loudly.

  What a pass certifies is narrow and must stay narrow in any claim
  derived from it: for this workload, fault schedule, and duration —
  full-mode: every acknowledged write survived and no fabricated rows
  appeared; relaxed modes: no acknowledged write outside the mode's
  loss window went missing; Elle lanes: none of the proscribed
  anomalies appeared in the observed history; compare: the two engines
  agreed on every generated statement. Jepsen proves the presence of
  bugs, never their absence."
