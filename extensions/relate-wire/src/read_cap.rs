//! The one bounded read shared by every whole-source reader, and the
//! per-record flavor a still-open stream reads through.
//!
//! `--fetch-params` sources (ADR-0267), `fs-to-graph` file content
//! (ADR-0157), `git-to-graph`'s `git log` stdout (ADR-0377), the extension
//! tarball's decompressed stream (ADR-0431 §2, the unpacker's bomb cap)
//! and the remote `--database` bundle (LABS-872) each have their own cap,
//! wording and overflow policy, but the capped read itself is two forms of
//! one refusal rule: the buffered [`read_capped`] (a `Vec`-sink adapter
//! over the chunked twin) and its chunked streaming form
//! [`read_capped_into`] (one fixed buffer under a `Read::take` of
//! `limit + 1`, so an oversized source costs one byte past the cap, never
//! a chunk) — a hostile or growing source cannot allocate past the cap
//! before the refusal, buffered or staged to a sink. The helpers report
//! the overflow; each caller maps it to its own error or `None`.
//!
//! [`read_line_capped`] is the same mechanism one line at a time — a
//! `BufRead::take` of `limit + 1` bytes around one `read_until` — for a
//! source that is still open after the line: the extension mount's host
//! reads its JSON-RPC stdout one line at a time (ADR-0442 §3), so a
//! hostile line cannot allocate past the line cap before the refusal.
//!
//! [`DeadlineReader`] is the same record read moved onto its own thread, so
//! its owner can bound each read with a deadline: a child that holds its
//! pipes and writes nothing stalls a read, never the host. The mount's
//! session loop and the `check` verb's staged session run every request
//! through it (ADR-0442's deferred read deadline). Its one-slot channel is
//! the pipe's own backpressure: the reader thread blocks until the host
//! consumes the line it already read, so a host doing store work never lets
//! the child's output pile up unbounded ahead of it.
//!
//! [`write_line`] is its writing twin: one payload, one terminator, one
//! flush — the shape every line the extension wires write shares, so the
//! envelope write, the host's responses and the child's requests cannot
//! each hand-roll it.
//!
//! [`drain_stderr`] is the bounded drain for the stderr of a child whose
//! stdout another thread reads capped: the whole stream is consumed (the
//! child never blocks on a full stderr pipe) while at most a stated number
//! of bytes is retained. `git-to-graph`'s `git log` (ADR-0377) and the
//! mount's children (ADR-0442) share it.
