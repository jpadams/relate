//! Body framing for the Query API reply seam (ADR-0386).
//!
//! A reply's framing is decided before its head goes out, from the
//! uncompressed serialized size: [`count_json`] runs one bounded counting
//! pass that keeps at most [`STREAM_THRESHOLD_BYTES`] - 1 bytes, so a body
//! that fits is written one-shot under `Content-Length` from exactly those
//! bytes, and a body at or above the threshold re-serializes straight into
//! the RFC 9112 chunked writer ([`write_chunked`]) — never into a
//! body-sized `Vec` copy.
//!
//! The body's wire shape — the success envelope's parts and their member
//! order — is [`crate::v2_envelope`]'s; this module only measures and
//! frames it. Every chunked body is framed through a fixed-size frame
//! buffer, and a producer write larger than that buffer is sliced into
//! frames of the same size, so no frame payload ever exceeds
//! [`FRAME_BUFFER_BYTES`]. A chunk boundary is therefore a buffer flush or a
//! slice edge — a transport detail clients must not depend on — never a row
//! or member boundary.
