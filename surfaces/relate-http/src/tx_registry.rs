//! The registry core of the Query API v2 `tx` routes (ADR-0237, ADR-0435):
//! a tx id maps to its engine [`Connection`] holding an open
//! `Connection::begin` transaction (ADR-0028). The engine's Connection is
//! `Send` but not `Sync`, so the registry lives behind a `Mutex` — but the
//! mutex is only ever held for registry bookkeeping, never across an
//! engine statement: the route family in [`crate::tx`] leases its entry out
//! of the map and runs the statement with the lock released. The lease has
//! two exits — [`Lease::release`] puts the entry back (a run),
//! [`Lease::take`] hands it to its one-way close (commit, rollback) (the
//! engine is single-writer anyway, so statements serialize at the commit
//! loop, not here).
//!
//! The lifecycle is ADR-0435's: every entry records the monotonic instant
//! it last did something, every registry operation reclaims entries idle
//! past the configured deadline in the one critical section it acts in —
//! the lease takes its target first and sweeps the rest (there is no
//! background reaper) — a swept [`Connection`] is dropped after the
//! registry lock is released — which rolls the transaction back and
//! releases its snapshot pin — and the registry refuses a begin at its cap
//! before the engine is asked for a pin. A begin's cap slot is a
//! reservation counted from `admit` until its entry registers, so the cap
//! holds under a burst of concurrent begins rather than only at a point in
//! time.
//!
//! This module is the registry core only; the route family — the request
//! body, the statement run, and the four handlers — lives in [`crate::tx`]
//! and reaches this module through [`TxRegistry`], the one public surface
//! (`lib.rs` re-exports it). The registry never names a route or a reply
//! type: a lookup miss is the typed [`LookupMiss`], and the route family
//! renders it.
//!
//! The limits are the typed [`TxLimits`] model (ADR-0435 §4): an idle
//! timeout of `None` disables expiry and a cap of `None` is unlimited.
//! [`TxLimits::new`] converts the wire's `0` spelling at that one boundary,
//! so no consumer here re-derives a zero sentinel.
