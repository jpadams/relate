//! `--load SOURCE` (LABS-903, ADR-0500): the source half of the two-axis
//! store grammar — `--database` names the store **target** (a local path or
//! `:memory:`), `--load` names where its content comes **from** (a `.rl`
//! path, a native directory, or an `http(s)` URL to a `.rl` bundle). The
//! two dispositions:
//!
//! - **The memory turn-into** — a `--load` whose target is a memory URI
//!   (the `--database` default): the source opens as
//!   [`relate::OpenMode::Ephemeral`], loads as usual, and then releases
//!   the source — nothing is held open or locked afterwards, and a fetched
//!   copy is removed right after the load. Read-only by construction.
//! - **The durable-target load** — a `--load` whose target is a path: the
//!   target must not exist yet (the load creates it), the source — fetched
//!   to scratch when remote — is cloned into it, the scratch is removed
//!   after the clone, and the run opens the target normally (writable by
//!   default). This is the one way to materialize a remote store at a path
//!   the caller chose.
//!
//! One module owns the grammar for both surfaces that carry the flag — the
//! query session and `serve` — so their `--load` behavior cannot drift:
//! [`memory_turn_into`] is the one derivation of the ephemeral fact,
//! [`access_mode`] the one open-mode resolution ([`Flags::open_mode`] and
//! serve's access build both delegate), [`parse_conflict`] the one
//! parse-time conflict policy, [`resolve`] the one target/source
//! resolution, and [`release_source_after_open`] the one post-open release
//! rule. Each surface reports the errors through its own exit contract
//! ([`LoadError::code`]).
