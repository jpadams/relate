//! The `run` verb mount (ADR-0429 §1, LABS-552): the reserved word, the
//! dispatch, the `run --help` page, the pinned discovery error, and the
//! telemetry wiring — the production consumer the extension tree's
//! slices (the wire, the registry, the host) landed ahead of.
//!
//! Every `run` invocation resolves the machine's installed extensions
//! FIRST (ADR-0429 §6 — the XDG walk, never the CWD), and a registry load
//! refusal — a malformed manifest, a name collision, an escaping
//! executable — fails the verb closed (exit 2, the refusal, the run
//! synopsis and hint, ADR-0430 §5's manifest class): the grammar `run`
//! accepts is a property of the user's machine, so a broken install
//! breaks the verb — help pages included — never a partial grammar or a
//! partial listing.
//!
//! Only an installed extension mounts under `run` (ADR-0429 §1): the
//! built-in `lab` actions are gone with the `lab` surface (ADR-0431
//! §11–§12 — the importers are installed packages now), so every
//! unresolvable name, whatever it used to be, fails closed with the
//! pinned discovery text (ADR-0429 §7), which names the first-party
//! install path and never fetches.
