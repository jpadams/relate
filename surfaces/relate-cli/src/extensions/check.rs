//! `relate extension check <dir>`: the six-stage package check
//! (ADR-0429 §6's load refusals, ADR-0430 §5's exit split, ADR-0447's mount
//! handshake) — the diagnostic an author runs before installing.
//!
//! The stages run in the mount's own order and each prints one line:
//!
//! 1. `manifest` — the package directory loads: `extension.json` present
//!    and strictly decoded, the executable inside the package directory,
//!    the mount name not a reserved command word, and the manifest a
//!    grammar the mount accepts (the protocol this host serves, no
//!    duplicate or store-shadowing flag names). Every refusal is the
//!    registry's or the `run` grammar's own text, rendered verbatim.
//! 2. `executable` — the declared file exists, is a regular file, and
//!    carries the exec bit where the platform has one.
//! 3. `spawn` — the process starts over the mount's std pipes and takes
//!    its request envelope (the flag table's defaults; a check passes no
//!    flags).
//! 4. `initialize` — the child's first request is `initialize`, names the
//!    MCP revision this host serves and carries its `clientInfo`; the
//!    check answers it with the mount's own result (the same
//!    [`initialize_facts`](crate::extensions::mcp::initialize_facts) the
//!    mount writes, over an empty unlimited store).
//! 5. `notifications/initialized` — the child confirms the handshake with
//!    MCP's id-less notification, the one message that may precede its
//!    first request.
//! 6. `tools/list` — the check serves the shared tool table (the wire
//!    kit's one table, [`extension_tools_list`]): a `tools/list` request
//!    is answered with it, and a `tools/call` must name one of its tools.
//!
//! A clean run then closes with one advisory status line about the
//! package's recorded GitHub pin (ADR-0449): `approved`, `drifted`, or
//! `not from a GitHub source`, read from the provenance marker and the
//! per-user trust store alone. The line is a report, never a stage: drift
//! does not stop the installed package from mounting (its bytes are the
//! ones that were approved, and the mount never consults the marker), so
//! it does not change the exit code — the install path is where a drifted
//! pin refuses. A marker or trust store that cannot be read is reported as
//! `unknown` with its own refusal text, never as one of the three states.
//!
//! The check opens no store and runs no tool: the handshake it answers
//! publishes an empty unlimited capacity ([`Capacity::new`]`(0, None)`) and
//! the session ends once the tool table is served — no tool executes, so a
//! check is safe against any store, writes nothing and runs offline. That
//! also means the child's own work (the walk an author is still writing)
//! never runs: the check proves the mount contract, not the import.
//!
//! Exit codes follow ADR-0430 §5's split: the package's declaration and
//! contents (stages 1-2) are the usage/manifest class, exit 2; what the
//! package does when run (stages 3-6) is the runtime class, exit 1; a clean
//! check exits 0.
//!
//! Reads are bounded: each expected request waits at most the caller's
//! deadline — the same value the mount's handshake window uses
//! ([`READ_DEADLINE`](crate::extensions::protocol::READ_DEADLINE)) — through
//! the shared deadline reader the mount's session loop also reads with
//! (ADR-0442's deferred read deadline), so a child that writes nothing (or
//! stops mid-session) fails its stage instead of hanging the check. The
//! check bounds every stage because it is a diagnostic; the mount bounds
//! only the handshake, because a working import may be slow between calls.
