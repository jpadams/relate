//! The ADR-0402 zero-effect write policy: the one batch gate both note sites
//! derive from, the fold that carries a run's effect into the transaction
//! ledger, and the two pinned stderr lines.
//!
//! The criterion itself is the engine's, not this crate's: `relate`'s
//! [`StatementEffect`] records whether a mutation operator reached execution
//! and whether the engine applied a change — the two facts a note may read.
//! The CLI adds only what is a CLI decision: batch sessions speak (the
//! interactive shell stays silent), a plan-producing run takes no
//! per-statement note (its plan table is its own report, while the effect it
//! carries still counts in the transaction ledger), a failed run reports its
//! failure instead of a note while its effect still folds in, and the exact
//! bytes a wrapper script may grep for live here beside the other
//! per-statement policies (`row_cap`, `timeout`).
