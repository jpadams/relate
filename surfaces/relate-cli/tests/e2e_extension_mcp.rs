//! The extension mount end-to-end (ADR-0442, ADR-0447): the compiled
//! `mcp-extension-fixture` child and the shell fixtures installed as
//! packages and driven through the real binary, under both commit policies.
//! The compiled fixture performs the whole surface in order (initialize and
//! its confirmation, update_schema, write_cypher with rows, read_cypher,
//! batch_cypher, report_output), so a green run proves the handshake, the
//! flag envelope, every tool including the multi-statement one, the commit
//! framing, the summary rendering, and the persisted store.
//!
//! The shell fixtures inline the bash MCP kit
//! (`docs/api/extensions/examples/mcp-client.sh`): `mcp_init` opens the
//! session and `mcp_call` round-trips a tool. A test that provokes a refusal sends the
//! offending line raw — a malformed line or a missing id cannot go through
//! a well-formed helper — and asserts the host's answer.
//!
//! The failure e2e drives a child that completes its tool calls and then
//! exits non-zero: the session's exit is classified inside the framed
//! import, so the run fails and a `whole-import` store stays empty — the
//! ordering the unit suite pins over scripted pipes.
//!
//! The unit suite (`src/extensions/mcp/tests.rs`) pins every refusal's
//! exact wording; this suite proves the real child and the real pipes.
