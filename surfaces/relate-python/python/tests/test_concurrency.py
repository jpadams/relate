"""Threading semantics: GIL release and connection thread affinity.

Two concerns (GH #352 / LABS-700):

- GIL release: ``execute`` / ``execute_arrow`` release the GIL around the
  Rust engine call, so other threads make progress while a query runs; the
  first tests assert many threads running queries concurrently all complete
  without deadlock -- exercising the ``py.allow_threads`` path end to end.
- Connection affinity: a ``Connection`` is usable only on the thread that
  opened it (``threadsafety == 1``). Cross-thread use is a typed
  ``ProgrammingError`` (never a pyo3 ``PanicException``), and releasing the
  last reference on another thread is safe.
