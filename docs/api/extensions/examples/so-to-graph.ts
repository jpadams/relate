/**
 * so-to-graph — the hello-world MCP extension in TypeScript: Stack Overflow
 * questions into a graph.
 *
 * An extension package is the MCP *client*: the host starts this process,
 * writes the request envelope (the resolved `--tag`/`--pages`/`--body`
 * values, one JSON line) on its stdin, and from then on the two pipes carry
 * JSON-RPC 2.0 — this process drives the host's tools (`update_schema`,
 * `write_cypher`, `read_cypher`, `batch_cypher`, `report_output`) and the
 * host alone owns the store.
 *
 * The corpus is live: the public Stack Exchange API's newest questions for
 * one tag, fetched with the corpus's standard filter — answers, owners,
 * tags and `body_markdown` embedded.
 * `--pages N` walks API pages 1..N, each a fresh request (the API's page size
 * is fixed at 100). The schema and the load are that notebook's sections 2-3:
 * a `SOGraph` graph type declared and promoted through `update_schema`, then
 * the API's rows as `(:Question)`, `(:Answer)`, `(:User)` nodes with `ASKED`,
 * `TAGGED`, `ANSWERED` and `PROVIDED` edges.
 *
 * `--body` writes the API's own `body_markdown` onto the question and answer
 * nodes (declared in the graph type, so the schema and the data agree).
 *
 * Data: Stack Overflow through the
 * [Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/questions); Stack
 * Overflow content is licensed
 * [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), and this
 * copy carries the same license. A question's `id` links back to
 * `https://stackoverflow.com/q/<id>`. Needs network access, and a fresh
 * store (the promoted graph type refuses a re-import of the same questions).
 *
 * Targeted SDK: **@modelcontextprotocol/client 2.x** (verified against
 * 2.4.0; the v2 SDK split into `@modelcontextprotocol/client` and
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/server`). The session, the handshake, the JSON-RPC
 * framing and the error mapping are the SDK's `Client` and its
 * `ReadBuffer`/`serializeMessage` helpers; the only piece the SDK does not
 * ship is a client transport over *this* process's own stdio (its
 * `StdioClientTransport` spawns a server), so `ProcessStdioTransport`
 * implements the SDK's `Transport` interface over the pipes we were handed.
 *
 * Docs: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/main/docs/advanced/custom-transports.md
 * and https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/main/docs/clients/connect.md
 *
 * Install it as a package (see `quickstart.md`): the package directory holds
 * this file, its `extension.json` and a `package.json` with `"type":
 * "module"` and the SDK dependency, `npm install` runs there, and the
 * directory is placed under the extension root by hand — `extension install
 * --from` copies exactly the manifest and the executable, and the SDK's
 * `node_modules` is neither.
 *
 *     relate run so-to-graph-ts --tag neo4j --pages 1 --body -d ./so
 *
 * Requires Node 22.18+ (TypeScript runs natively) and the host's
 * `initialize` result carrying the standard `protocolVersion` and
 * `capabilities` fields the SDK validates (`spec.md`, "Handshake").
