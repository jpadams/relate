"""so-to-graph — the hello-world MCP extension in Python: Stack Overflow
questions into a graph.

An extension package is the MCP *client*: the host starts this process,
writes the request envelope (the resolved ``--tag``/``--pages``/``--body``
values, one JSON line) on its stdin, and from then on the two pipes carry
JSON-RPC 2.0 — this process drives the host's tools (``update_schema``,
``write_cypher``, ``read_cypher``, ``batch_cypher``, ``report_output``) and
the host alone owns the store.

The corpus is live: the public Stack Exchange API's newest questions for one
tag, fetched with the corpus's standard filter — answers, owners, tags
and ``body_markdown`` embedded.
``--pages N`` walks API pages 1..N, each a fresh request (the API's page size
is fixed at 100). The schema and the load are the notebook's (its sections
2-3): a ``SOGraph`` graph type declared and promoted through
``update_schema`` — questions, answers, users and tags with their typed
properties and the four relationship types — and then the API's rows as
``(:Question)``, ``(:Answer)``, ``(:User)`` nodes with ``ASKED``,
``TAGGED``, ``ANSWERED`` and ``PROVIDED`` edges.

Data: Stack Overflow through the
[Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/questions); Stack
Overflow content is licensed
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), and this
copy carries the same license. A question's ``id`` links back to
``https://stackoverflow.com/q/<id>``. Needs network access, and a fresh
store (the constraints refuse a re-import of the same questions).

Targeted SDK: **mcp 2.x** (verified against 2.3.0). The client is created
with ``mode="legacy"``: this host serves the handshake-era protocol, so the
SDK must open with the ``initialize`` handshake instead of its modern
``server/discover`` probe. The session, the handshake, the protocol
negotiation, the JSON-RPC framing and the error mapping are the SDK's
``mcp.Client``; the only piece the SDK does not ship is a client transport
over *this* process's own stdin/stdout (its ``stdio_client`` spawns a server
instead), so ``OwnStdio`` bridges those two pipes through the SDK's
``Transport`` protocol and its own line parser
(``mcp_types.jsonrpc_message_adapter``). A shipped child-side stdio
transport would remove even that adapter.

``--body`` writes the API's own ``body_markdown`` onto the question and
answer nodes (declared in the graph type, so the schema and the data agree).

Docs: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/2026-07-28/develop/build-client
and https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/2026-07-28/clients/client-best-practices

Install it as a package (see ``quickstart.md``)::

    relate extension install so-to-graph-py --from ./so-to-graph-py
    relate run so-to-graph-py --tag neo4j --pages 1 --body -d ./so

Requires the ``mcp`` SDK (``pip install 'mcp>=2'``); the host's
``initialize`` result carries the standard ``protocolVersion`` and
``capabilities`` fields the SDK validates (``spec.md``, "Handshake").
