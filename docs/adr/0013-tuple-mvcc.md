# 0013. Tuple-level MVCC for snapshot reads

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-08-28
- **Deciders**: MemoryDB maintainers

## Context

ADR-0011 gave readers snapshot isolation by cloning the entire in-memory
graph under a read lock. That clone is expensive on dataset-scale graphs
and still serializes the start of every read behind the `RwLock`. A WAL
(ADR-0012) makes optimistic rollback less necessary: durability is the
log, not undo of a published commit. Versioned tuples are now justified.

## Decision

- Each stored node and relationship version has **`xmin` / `xmax`**.
  `xmax = 0` means the version is live. `SET`/`REMOVE` install a new
  version of the same Cypher identity (`NodeId` / `RelId`). `DELETE`
  sets `xmax`.
- A **read** query pins `snapshot_ts = last_committed` and uses
  visibility `xmin <= snapshot_ts && (xmax == 0 || xmax > snapshot_ts)`.
  It does **not** clone the graph.
- **Writers serialize** (exclusive write lock). MVCC is for concurrent
  readers, not write-write concurrency.
- Indexes (ADR-0010) return candidate ids; the executor filters by
  visibility. Checkpoint (ADR-0012) writes only rows visible at the
  checkpoint snapshot and GCs versions with `xmax <= checkpoint_ts`
  when no reader is pinned older than that.
- Public `Node` / `Relationship` values returned to clients do not
  expose xmin/xmax.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep clone-on-read (ADR-0011)** — correct snapshots, O(graph) copy
  per MATCH. Rejected now that WAL exists and dataset graphs are large
  enough for the clone to matter.
- **Concurrent writers / SSI** — extra conflict detection. Rejected;
  writers stay serialized.
- **Store all versions in Parquet** — checkpoint stays a latest-visible
  snapshot (ADR-0005 / ADR-0012). Rejected; MVCC is in RAM only.
- **Copy-on-write generation trees** — similar isolation, harder
  adjacency/index updates. Rejected in favor of xmin/xmax chains.

## Consequences

- Read queries no longer take a long-lived exclusive copy of `Graph`.
- Bolt BEGIN/COMMIT remain auto-commit no-ops (ADR-0011 consequence
  carried forward).
- Executor MATCH/expand/index scans must honor `snapshot_ts`.
- ADR-0011 is superseded.

## Later references

ADR-0015: writers no longer hold the exclusive lock for the whole
statement. Snapshot reads are unchanged; write-write conflicts are
checked when the WAL assigns `commit_ts`.

ADR-0018: `apply_redo` no longer needs the exclusive graph lock.
Snapshot queries and apply overlap; visibility is still `xmin`/`xmax`.
