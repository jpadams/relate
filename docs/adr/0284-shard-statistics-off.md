# 0284. Shard writer stores no page statistics

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Renumbered**: from 0164 (shared-number cleanup)

- **Deciders**: CypherLite maintainers

## Context

ADR-0086 §3 parses each Parquet page header before decompression and limits
that parse to 64 KiB. The shard writer uses Arrow's default statistics,
which is page level with no truncation. For a string column, the page header
then contains the full minimum and maximum values on that page.

Node and relationship properties are one string column. A property value can
be far larger than 64 KiB. The header parse steps over that whole value, runs
past the 64 KiB window, and rejects the shard with `page header length`. The
loader reads every row of a shard into memory and never consults the minimum
or maximum.

## Decision

The shard writer disables Parquet statistics (`EnabledStatistics::None`).
Property values stay in the page payload. Both node and relationship shards
go through this writer.

A later ADR may turn statistics back on as a prefix of the minimum and
maximum value, short enough to fit in the 64 KiB header, if pagination needs
to skip pages on disk.

## Alternatives considered

- **Store the full minimum and maximum.** Rejected: a property string can
  exceed the 64 KiB header window, and the loader does not read the header
  value.
- **Store only the size of the minimum and maximum.** Rejected: the Parquet
  field is the value, and a size cannot skip a page.
- **Truncate to a prefix now.** Rejected: no reader skips pages. A prefix is
  the shape to restore if one does, not the current writer setting.

## Consequences

A checkpoint of a graph whose properties are larger than 64 KiB passes the
ADR-0086 page-header preflight. Shards already published are unchanged. The
preflight still runs before a shard is renamed into place, so a header that
fails it is not published.
