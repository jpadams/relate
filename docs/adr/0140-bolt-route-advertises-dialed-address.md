# 0140. Bolt ROUTE advertises the dialed address

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-09-29
- **Deciders**: CypherLite maintainers

## Context

ADR-0269 settled that ROUTE (`0x66`) answers with a single-server self
routing table, and chose the `<self>` address as the listener's resolved bind
address, falling back to the connection's local socket address only when the
bind is unspecified (`0.0.0.0`/`::`).

That rule breaks behind Docker port mapping and NAT. The shipped image
(ADR-0128) binds `0.0.0.0:7687` inside the container, so the bind is
unspecified and the fallback fires: the connection's local address is the
**container-internal** IP (e.g. `172.17.0.2:7687`). A driver on the host
dialed `localhost:7687` (published port), receives `172.17.0.2:7687` in the
routing table, and cannot reach it — every subsequent RUN fails. The rule
also **discloses the internal address** to clients, which is information a
server should not volunteer.

The address the client dialed — the routing-context `address` the driver
sends in ROUTE — is reachable from that client by construction: it is the
address this very connection arrived on.

This decision supersedes ADR-0269's `<self>` derivation; it was settled by
the maintainer before this ADR was written.

## Decision

ROUTE (`0x66`) fills `rt.servers[*].addresses` with, in order:

1. **The routing-context `address` the client sent**, when present and
   non-empty. That address reached this server for this client, so it is
   routable for this client.
2. Otherwise, **the connection's local socket address** — the fallback for
   clients that send an empty or absent routing context (some non-browser
   drivers do).

Everything else in ADR-0269 stands: the three roles (`ROUTE`/`READ`/`WRITE`),
ttl 300, the `db` echo, and ROUTE being answered regardless of failed state
behind the ADR-0126 auth gate.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep the ADR-0269 rule (resolved bind, else connection-local).**
  Rejected: behind Docker port mapping or NAT it hands the client an
  unroutable container-internal address, breaking every routed session, and
  it leaks the internal address to clients.
- **An `--advertised-address` flag.** Deferred: an operator-set advertised
  address is the right answer for deployments where even the dialed address
  is not the desired long-term one (multi-homed hosts, proxies that rewrite
  destinations), but no such deployment need is in front of us; it is
  recorded here as the future step, not built now.
- **Always echo the routing-context address, with no fallback.** Rejected:
  non-browser clients may send an empty or absent routing context, and they
  still need a usable table; the connection-local address covers them.

## Consequences

- The single-server scope is unchanged (ADR-0269): one server, three roles,
  every RUN routed back to the connection the driver already has.
- Clients receive the address they dialed, which is reachable for them by
  construction; Docker and NAT deployments work without operator
  configuration, and the container-internal address is no longer disclosed.
- A client that dialed a DNS name gets that DNS name back; one that dialed
  an IP gets the IP. Neither is resolved or rewritten.
- `--advertised-address` is the named follow-up if a deployment needs an
  operator-set address; adding it will be a new ADR refining this one.
- Tests must pin the dialed-address-first rule, the local-address fallback
  for empty/absent routing contexts, and the ADR-0269 invariants (roles,
  ttl, db echo).
- Supersedes the `<self>` address derivation of ADR-0269; ADR-0269 gains a
  **Later references** note pointing here.
