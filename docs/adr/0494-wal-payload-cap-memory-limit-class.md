# ADR-0494: The WAL payload cap refusal is the memory-limit class on every surface

Status: Proposed
Claim: 987686a6720f960a4cf7a08d37b5a45b03fede3e

## Context

ADR-0492 typed the 64 MiB per-record WAL payload cap (ADR-0086) refusal
as the fieldless `Error::WalPayloadCap` and — deliberately, as its
scope — kept the storage classification every surface gave the `Storage`
prose predecessor: CLI family `Storage` (exit 1), Bolt `ErrorClass::
Internal` (genericized to `Neo.DatabaseError.General.UnknownError` with
the fixed message `internal error` at the trust boundary), HTTP 400 (the
reply fall-through), and binding metadata `("StorageError",
"SemanticError")` for the C ABI and Python adapter.

ADR-0492's first rejected alternative recorded why that classification
is wrong: the refusal is semantically a capacity condition — the record
cannot be journaled because building it would exhaust memory — and the
storage class misinforms every caller that branches on the class: a
client counting memory-limit refusals, an HTTP gateway mapping 507, a
driver surfacing memory conditions, an operator reading `internal
error` for a statement the user simply made too large. It was rejected
only because reclassifying changes the error's *kind*, which ADR-0003
defines as contract and therefore breaking.

The human decision (Michael, 2026-11-03, LABS-862) removes that barrier:
CypherLite has no external clients yet — the contract is young — so the
kind change breaks no one, and reclassifying now is cheaper than a compat
migration later. The decision also picked the class name:
`MemoryLimitExceeded`, the kind string the binding metadata already
gives `Error::Capacity`.

## Decision

**The refusal is a `CapacityKind::WalPayload` refusal on the existing
`Error::Capacity` variant — one memory/capacity-limit family across the
whole public API — and every surface classifies it with its
memory-limit class.** The per-surface mapping, moving ADR-0492's table:

| Surface | Was (ADR-0492) | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rust public API | `Error::WalPayloadCap`, storage class | `Error::Capacity { used, limit, kind: CapacityKind::WalPayload }` |
| C ABI + Python (`binding_error_metadata`) | `("StorageError", "SemanticError")` | `("MemoryLimitExceeded", "ArgumentError")` — the same pair every other capacity refusal carries |
| HTTP | 400 (the reply fall-through) | **507 Insufficient Storage** (the `Error::Capacity` row of `run_error`) |
| Bolt | `ErrorClass::Internal` → genericized `Neo.DatabaseError.General.UnknownError` / `internal error` | `ErrorClass::Runtime(TRANSACTION_OUT_OF_MEMORY_CODE)` → `Neo.ClientError.General.TransactionOutOfMemoryError`, the Neo4j memory code in the non-retryable `ClientError` class, engine message passed through verbatim — the same code the other two memory conditions (graph cap, `--max-result-bytes`) use |
| CLI | `(Fatal, ErrorFamily::Storage)` → envelope `kind` `storage` | `(Fatal, ErrorFamily::Capacity)` → envelope `kind` `capacity`, exit 1 |

1. `Error::WalPayloadCap` is removed; `CapacityKind` gains `WalPayload`.
   The refusal is `Error::Capacity { used, limit, kind:
   CapacityKind::WalPayload }`, with `limit` the bound the check
   consulted (`Error::WAL_PAYLOAD_CAP_BYTES` at both refusal sites) and
   `used` the counted byte total at which the bounded serializer was
   stopped — a lower bound of the record the statement tried to commit,
   never its final size. This supersedes ADR-0492 alternative 3's
   "the site knows only that the bound was crossed": the bounded sink
   now records the crossing count, so the fields carry real values.
   `Error::WAL_PAYLOAD_CAP_BYTES` stays the one public spelling of the
   cap; the encoder, scanner and tests consume it unchanged.
2. The `BoundedSink` refusal becomes a two-arm shape — the caller's
   fixed error (the snapshot manifest bound, the Parquet shard
   envelope), or a capacity refusal parameterized by the crossing
   count, the bound and the `CapacityKind` — the sink stays
   caller-agnostic, knowing the capacity family, never which
   subsystem's cap refused; the WAL encoder spells its (bound, kind)
   pair exactly once, so no bounded pass over a commit record can pair
   the kind with a different limit. Still one error channel: the
   io abort the in-flight serializer sees renders the same error
   `BoundedSink::finish` returns; the serializer's own abort is
   discarded as before.
3. Display: ADR-0492's byte-identical-to-`Storage` requirement is
   lifted. The refusal renders through the one capacity renderer
   (`capacity_detail`) as the communicative line the house style
   requires — what hit the limit (a single WAL commit record), how far
   it got (at least N MB), the knob (the per-record WAL payload cap),
   and the action (commit the data in smaller transactions) — both byte
   figures rendered through the one `human_bytes` policy from the
   `limit` the check consulted, never a second inline conversion.
   Unlike the ADR-0463 expression cap, the cap is a fixed engine bound,
   so the line offers no raise-it knob.

The WAL scanner's over-cap length diagnostic stays `Error::Storage`
(`invalid WAL payload length …`): a corrupt or newer-written segment is
not a refused commit (ADR-0492, unchanged).

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep the storage class, as ADR-0492 landed it.** Rejected: the class
  misinforms every class-branching caller, and Bolt's genericization
  hides a user-fixable condition (a too-large single commit) behind
  `internal error` — the exact communicative-error failure the house
  style exists to remove. The kind-change barrier fell with the
  no-external-clients decision.
- **Keep `Error::WalPayloadCap` as its own variant, re-rendered in the
  capacity style and reclassified per surface.** Rejected: two variants
  for one semantic class is parallel state — every surface's capacity
  arm and every future consumer matching "the memory limit" must list
  both, and the two can drift. Folding into the one `Capacity` variant
  means a consumer matching `Error::Capacity { .. }` already catches the
  refusal, and no surface grows a new arm (the storage arms shrink).
- **A payload-carrying `WalPayloadCap { used, limit }` variant (ADR-0492
  alternative 3).** Rejected for the same parallel-state reason, and
  because a refusal variant beside `Capacity` re-derives the capacity
  rendering instead of sharing `capacity_detail`'s one policy.
- **Defer the reclassification until a compat story is needed.**
  Rejected: the contract is young precisely so it can be corrected
  cheaply; every month of storage-classified refusals is a month of
  callers the later migration would break.

## Consequences

- `Error::WalPayloadCap` is gone: every exhaustive match that listed it
  (the binding metadata, the CLI classifier, the Bolt classifier) drops
  the arm, compiler-checked. The cancellation ladder's
  `refused_for_wal_payload_cap` matches
  `Error::Capacity { kind: CapacityKind::WalPayload, .. }` — still
  discriminable by variant, never by prose.
- The refusal's message text changes (the storage prefix and the
  byte-identical pinning go), and its class changes on every surface:
  HTTP 400 → 507, Bolt `Neo.DatabaseError.General.UnknownError` →
  `Neo.ClientError.General.TransactionOutOfMemoryError` (message no
  longer genericized), binding kind `StorageError` →
  `MemoryLimitExceeded` (Python's DB-API mapping is unchanged: the kind
  falls through to the `ArgumentError` class → `DataError`, the same
  exception the graph cap raises), CLI envelope kind `storage` →
  `capacity`. Pinned tests move with the change in the same commit.
- Coverage guarantee: no Cypher-level behavior moves — the TCK corpus
  (3892 scenarios) and the CIP-eval frozen set contain no scenario that
  trips a 64 MiB per-record cap, and the graph- and expression-capacity
  Displays are byte-identical to before, so the pinned TCK/CIP numbers
  and the spec-harness coverage lane (ADR-0482) are unaffected; the
  full TCK run in this change's gate confirms 3892 of 3892.
- ADR-0492's Decision paragraphs 1 and 3 (the fieldless variant, the
  storage classification) are superseded by this ADR; its
  single-sourced `WAL_PAYLOAD_CAP_BYTES` constant and its scanner
  diagnostic distinction stand unchanged.
