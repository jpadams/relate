# 0106. JSON checkpoints carry pull identity inline

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2026-09-25
- **Deciders**: CypherLite maintainers (Linear LABS-104)

## Context

`cypherlite pull` (ADR-0080) is a source-scoped upsert. It keys every pulled
element by `(source, kind, remote elementId)` and records the local id in a
pull-identity map. The map is written as WAL ops in the same commit as the
graph changes and is restored at checkpoint load. ADR-0092 binds the map to
the snapshot: the v3 Parquet manifest selects one immutable sidecar object,
`pull-identity/<hex>.json`, through `pull_identity_path`.

Only the Parquet snapshot path implements this. The JSON codec (ADR-0050)
writes and reads the `GraphData` envelope in `graph.json`, and that envelope
has no pull identity. `pull` checkpoints right after loading, and close
checkpoints again and recycles the WAL. In a JSON store the mappings are
therefore gone after the first pull, and a repeat pull duplicates nodes and
relationships instead of reusing them — the same bug ADR-0080 fixed for
Parquet.

ADR-0105 (open, not yet on `main`) puts the Parquet codec behind an additive
`parquet` Cargo feature. It makes `pull` require that feature "for now",
because pull identity is Parquet-only, and names LABS-104 as the follow-up
that removes the coupling so the CLI `agent` bundle (ADR-0104) can drop
Arrow/Parquet.

The reasons ADR-0092 uses a separate sidecar do not carry over to JSON.
Parquet checkpoints are incremental (ADR-0022): a sidecar avoids rewriting
unchanged mappings, and the manifest is the one atomic publication point for
many objects. JSON `dump` rewrites all of `graph.json` on every checkpoint,
and `graph.json` is already the single atomic unit of a JSON snapshot.

## Decision

1. **Inline field.** Add an optional `pull_identity` field to the JSON
   `GraphData` envelope in `graph.json`:

   ```rust
   #[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Vec::is_empty")]
   pull_identity: Vec<PullIdentityEntry>,
   ```

   `PullIdentityEntry` is the existing `cypherlite_executor` type
   (`source`, `kind` as lowercase `node`/`rel`, `remote_id`, `local_id`).
   No new wire type and no format-version bump.

2. **Dump.** JSON `dump` writes `Graph::pull_identity_entries()` into the
   field as part of the same full `graph.json` rewrite. An empty map writes
   nothing.

3. **Load.** JSON `load` restores the field with
   `Graph::restore_pull_identity` before WAL replay. A missing field is an
   empty map. WAL `PullIdentityPut` replay is unchanged (ADR-0080).

4. **Validation.** Every `local_id` is checked with
   `PullIdentityEntry::validate_local_ids` on dump and on load, the same
   shared check the Parquet path uses. Entries are part of `graph.json` and share its existing
   read path; no separate size envelope is added.

5. **Parquet unchanged.** The ADR-0092 manifest-selected sidecar, its
   selector validation, legacy fallback and cleanup stay as they are. The
   JSON `manifest.json` envelope is unchanged.

## Alternatives considered

- **One codec-neutral, manifest-selected pull-identity sidecar for both
  codecs** (reuse the ADR-0092 machinery in the JSON path). Rejected: JSON is
  a full-rewrite codec, so a sidecar gives no write-amplification benefit.
  It would drag manifest-selected objects, selector validation and orphan
  object GC into the JSON path, and it needs a new selector field in the
  JSON `manifest.json` envelope. That is more publication surface for no
  gain over one atomically replaced `graph.json`.
- **Leave the JSON gap and keep `pull` coupled to the `parquet` feature
  permanently** (make ADR-0105's "for now" final). Rejected: a repeat pull
  into a JSON store silently duplicates data today, and the coupling keeps
  Arrow/Parquet in the `agent` CLI bundle.
- **Store the entries in the JSON `manifest.json` envelope.** Rejected:
  `manifest.json` is bounded metadata (ADR-0086) and would inflate with
  every pulled element. It is also a second file written separately from
  `graph.json`, which reopens the mixed-generation problem ADR-0092 fixed.
- **A mutable `pull-identity.json` next to `graph.json`.** Rejected: two
  independently replaced files cannot be published atomically — the exact
  failure ADR-0092 was written to remove.

## Consequences

- **Backward compatible.** A `graph.json` written before this change has
  no field and loads with an empty map, which is today's behavior.
  `GraphData` does not use `deny_unknown_fields`, so an older binary reading
  a new `graph.json` ignores the field and loses the mappings — also
  today's behavior, not a new failure.
- **Zero cost when unused.** A store that never pulled writes no extra
  bytes; its `graph.json` is byte-identical to before.
- **Idempotent pull on JSON.** A repeat pull into a JSON store reuses
  mapped elements instead of duplicating them, matching Parquet.
- **Tests required.** JSON dump/load roundtrip of pull identity on Native
  and Memory VFS and inside a `.cl` bundle (ADR-0074); load of an old
  `graph.json` without the field; rejection of an invalid `local_id`; and a
  CLI end-to-end repeat pull against a JSON store that asserts node and
  relationship counts do not grow.
- **Unblocks ADR-0105 follow-up.** Once this lands, `pull` no longer needs
  the `parquet` feature and the CLI `agent` bundle can drop Arrow/Parquet.
  That change is recorded in ADR-0105 § "Pull does not require Parquet".
- The Parquet snapshot path and ADR-0092 are untouched.
