# 0270. CLI flags parse in every build: split `--fetch-params` parsing from its fetch

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Renumbered**: from 0137 (shared-number cleanup)
- **Date**: 2026-09-29
- **Deciders**: CypherLite maintainers (agreed in conversation)

## Context

ADR-0267 shipped `--fetch-params` with the whole `fetch_params` module — including
the `NAME=SOURCE` splitting and source classification — behind the `fetch-params`
cargo feature. That made flag *recognition* itself feature-gated: in the `minimal`
bundle `--fetch-params` hits the generic unknown-flag usage error.

ADR-0104's invariant is "every flag parses in every build" (only a *value* can
require a compiled-in capability — `--snapshot-format parquet` parses everywhere
and fails closed at open, per ADR-0105), and compiled-out *commands* still
recognize and fail with a typed not-included error. ADR-0267's shape was the
first flag to break that, and the ADR-0104 exception paragraph written for it
was self-contradictory ("the flag still parses … without the feature it hits
the unknown-flag usage error").

The parse half of `fetch_params` (`parse_fetch_assignment`, `FetchSource`) is
pure string/`PathBuf` code with no `ureq` dependency — only the fetch half
(`fetch_source`/`fetch_url`/`read_file`/`read_capped`) needs the feature.

## Decision

Split parse from fetch:

- `parse_fetch_assignment`/`FetchSource` move ungated into `params.rs` (alongside
  the other argv decode helpers); the `--fetch-params` match arm in `main.rs` is
  ungated. The flag parses in every build, restoring ADR-0104's invariant.
- Only the fetch module stays behind the `fetch-params` feature. `params::resolve`
  fails closed without it: a parsed `--fetch-params` value is a runtime error
  (exit 1) with `--fetch-params is not compiled into this build (enable the
  "fetch-params" feature)` — the `--snapshot-format parquet` fails-closed
  precedent (ADR-0105).
- `--help` still lists `--fetch-params` only when compiled in (the commands and
  codecs precedent); the e2e bundle suite pins both the help parity and the
  fails-closed message.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep recognition gated (ADR-0267 as shipped)** — rejected: a flag that exists
  in the product erroring as "unknown flag" in a smaller bundle gives users a
  generic message instead of the typed not-compiled guidance, and it set a
  divergent convention for the next gated flag.
- **Fail closed at parse time (usage error, exit 2)** — rejected: a *value*
  parse succeeded; the missing capability is a runtime condition, and parquet
  already established fails-closed-after-parse for compiled-out capability.
- **Ungate the fetch too (drop the feature)** — rejected: the bundle contract
  (ADR-0104) exists precisely so `minimal` can exclude the `ureq` HTTP surface;
  the fetch must stay physically absent there.

## Consequences

- "Every flag parses in every build" holds again for every current flag; the
  ADR-0104 exception paragraph reverts to stating the invariant holds (fails
  closed without the feature).
- `minimal`-bundle users get the typed message telling them which feature to
  enable instead of "unknown flag".
- Three of the previous `#[cfg]` sites around the flag disappear; the parse
  tests run ungated in every bundle.
- This amends ADR-0267 (see its Later references note); ADR-0267's caps, trust
  model, and `full`/`agent` bundle membership are unchanged.
