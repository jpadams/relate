# ADR-0240: TTY-adaptive JSON pretty-printing and `--pretty`

Status: Accepted

## Context

(Numbered ADR-0227 when written; renumbered to avoid a collision
with the ontology ADR ADR-0227 that landed on main first.)

LABS-233 (agent-CLI audit, `docs/agent-cli-audit.md` finding 6). The `json`
output mode always pretty-printed: a one-scalar result cost four lines. The
consumers of piped JSON are programs — `jq`, agent harnesses, model contexts
— for whom whitespace is pure token cost (the audit's compactness principle:
compact at the source, pretty on demand). Meanwhile a human running
`--json` at a terminal benefits from the indentation. ADR-0107 already made
the *mode* default TTY-adaptive (`table` on a terminal, `jsonl` otherwise);
the *rendering* of an explicitly chosen `json` mode was not.

## Decision

1. **`json` mode renders compact when stdout is not a terminal**, indented
   when it is. The CLI resolves this once, next to the ADR-0107 mode
   default: `Formatter.pretty = stdout.is_terminal() || --pretty`.
2. **`--pretty` forces indented JSON** regardless of the terminal
   detection (a pipe into a file a human will read). It is a query-run flag,
   double-dash only, meaningful only to `json` mode; `jsonl` and `envelope`
   are always compact and ignore it.
3. **`Formatter.pretty` defaults to `true`** in `cypherlite-formatter`, so
   existing library callers keep the historical pretty output; the CLI is
   the surface that adapts to the terminal.
4. Docs, help text, and tests land in the same change.

## Alternatives considered

- **Always compact (`--json` changes meaning for everyone)** — rejected:
  a human asking for `--json` at a terminal gets an unreadable wall of
  text; the TTY split keeps both audiences served, matching ADR-0107.
- **A `--compact` flag instead, pretty by default** — rejected: the default
  should already be right for the common consumer (a pipe), not require
  every harness to opt out of whitespace.
- **Compact `jsonl` only, drop pretty `json` entirely** — rejected: the
  single-document JSON form is useful for tooling that wants one value
  (`jq -s` gymnastics aside); this ADR changes only its whitespace.

## Consequences

- Piped `--json` output is one line; byte-identical information, less
  whitespace. Golden tests that pinned multi-line pretty JSON under a pipe
  updated to the compact form (or pass `--pretty`).
- `Formatter` gains a public `pretty` field — an additive change to the
  formatter crate's API.
- The ADR-0194 error envelope on stdout (`{"error":…}`) was already
  compact and is unchanged.
