# ADR-0353: Bolt RUN SUCCESS depth-truncation marker for structured plans

Claim: e05853d70e9f81f02a7472b3c25c5beaa7c303a8
Status: Accepted

**Later references**: ADR-0357 moves the plan summary — and with it this
marker — from the RUN SUCCESS to the SUCCESS that ends the result (the
PULL/DISCARD that consumes its last row), Neo4j's placement. The marker's
meaning and the depth-limit policy are unchanged.

## Context

ADR-0344/0345 carry an `EXPLAIN`/`PROFILE` statement's structured plan in
the Bolt RUN SUCCESS summary (`plan` / `profile`). A pathological
statement — e.g. a hundred chained `WITH` clauses, each nesting one
operator deeper — can nest the plan tree past packstream's container
depth limit (128). `Pack::from_mdb` then fails, and the summary carried no
plan key at all: a depth-truncated `PROFILE` was wire-indistinguishable
from a plain run (the passthrough test pins that a plain run carries
neither key), so a client could not tell "no plan" from "plan too deep to
pack" — the pack failure was silent (LABS-346 finding 1).

## Decision

When the pack conversion of the plan tree fails, the RUN SUCCESS summary
carries `planTruncated: true` instead of the `plan`/`profile` key. The
plan key itself stays absent (nothing half-packs); the marker is a
Bolt-transport fact — the depth limit is this boundary's, so no other
surface (HTTP, CLI, FFI) carries an equivalent key and the result-metadata
alignment rule is not extended. The statement's own rows are unaffected.
Pinned by the protocol test `run_success_marks_a_depth_truncated_plan`
beside the passthrough test.

## Alternatives considered

- Keep silently omitting the key — rejected: indistinguishable from a
  plain run (the failure LABS-346 filed); a client profiling a deep
  statement would believe the statement carried no plan.
- Pack a depth-truncated plan tree (cut at the limit) under the key —
  rejected: the shared `PlanNode::to_value` wire form (ADR-0345) would
  gain a depth-aware variant every surface reads, for a pathological
  case; a partial tree also reads as a complete plan unless every
  consumer learns the cut marker anyway.
- Fail the RUN — rejected: the statement itself executed fine; only this
  transport's depth limit cannot carry the summary metadata.
- Move the marker into the engine's `QueryResult` metadata — rejected:
  the truncation is caused by this surface's packstream limit, not by the
  engine (JSON-carrying surfaces have no such limit); embedding it in the
  shared result would force a null-ish default on every other surface.

## Consequences

- Bolt clients can distinguish a depth-truncated `EXPLAIN`/`PROFILE` from
  a plain run; the marker is advisory, and Neo4j drivers ignore unknown
  summary keys (the same posture as the `columnTypes` extension,
  ADR-0224).
- `docs/api/bolt/spec.md` documents the key beside the structured-plan
  section.
- The end-to-end driver-facing plan-summary shape (field names drivers
  actually parse) remains under investigation in LABS-349.

## Later references

- ADR-0357 moves the plan pair — and with it this marker — to the final
  PULL/DISCARD SUCCESS (Neo4j's placement, so clients that read only the
  drained result's summary see it). The depth policy, the marker key and
  the "never half-pack" rule are unchanged; the pinning test is
  `pull_success_marks_a_depth_truncated_plan` beside the passthrough test.
