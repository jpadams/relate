# 0034. Bound `shortestPath` is bidirectional BFS

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-09-01
- **Deciders**: MemoryDB maintainers

## Context

ADR-0025 evaluates `shortestPath` with unidirectional BFS. That is
O(reachable nodes within `max_hops`) from the start. The fraud
`payment_path` query binds both ends:

```cypher
MATCH (a:Account {id: $from}), (b:Account {id: $to})
RETURN length(shortestPath((a)-[:TRANSFER*1..3]->(b))) AS hops
```

After Waves 1–3 and streaming `DISTINCT`+`LIMIT`, that use case is
~37% of 0.30 read-only CPU. p50 is ~1.7 ms; **mean is ~5.7 ms**
because a miss or a 3-hop hit walks the start’s 3-hop out-ball
(degree tens to hundreds). ADR-0025 rejected bidirectional BFS until
a benchmark showed it matters. It does.

openCypher still needs one shortest trail or `null`. The hop cap
stays.

## Decision

When **both** endpoints of a single-relationship `shortestPath` are
bound, search with **bidirectional BFS**:

- Forward from the start on the pattern direction; backward from the
  end on the reverse (`->` uses incoming, `-` uses both).
- Expand the smaller frontier, one BFS layer at a time. The shortest
  meet in a finished layer is the answer (do not take the first edge
  meet inside a layer).
- Accept a meet only when `d_front + d_back` is in `[min_hops,
  max_hops]`. Stop when no remaining queued node can beat `max_hops`
  or a found length.
- Reconstruct one trail from the two parent maps. The no-rel-reuse
  rule applies to the spliced trail.
- Unbound end stays on unidirectional BFS (ADR-0025).
- `allShortestPaths` stays unidirectional. Multi-rel patterns stay
  enumerate-then-min.

`length(shortestPath(…))` may return the hop count without building a
`Path` (no node/rel inflate). `length(allShortestPaths(…))` is still
the list size.

Same contract as ADR-0025: one shortest path or `null`, default max
32, zero-length when `min_hops == 0` and start already matches end.
Unit tests in `memorydb` stay the language carrier.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep unidirectional BFS** — correct, still O(d³) on a 3-hop
  miss. Rejected; the 0.30 mix is now this query.
- **Bidirectional `allShortestPaths`** — must enumerate every
  min-length splice. More code, not on the fraud mix. Rejected for
  this ADR.
- **Cache `shortestPath` results** — needs invalidation on every
  write. Rejected in ADR-0033; this ADR is less search, not a cache.
- **Drop `payment_path` or cap hops at 1** — already rejected in
  ADR-0025.

## Consequences

- A 3-hop hit is ~`2·d²` visits instead of ~`d³` when both ends have
  comparable degree. A high-degree start and a low-degree end expand
  the small side first.
- A miss still respects `max_hops`; it does not walk two full
  3-hop balls.
- Identity `REPORTS_TO*..8` (undirected, both ends bound) uses the
  same path.
- TCK Path features still do not cover `shortestPath`.

## Later references

ADR-0037: bound directed `shortestPath` with `max_hops ≤ 3` is
1-hop / 2-hop intersect / 3-hop first-meet, not a finished last
bidir layer. Generic bidir stays for `max_hops > 3` and undirected.
