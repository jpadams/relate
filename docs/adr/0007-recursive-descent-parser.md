# 0007. Cypher is parsed with a hand-written recursive-descent parser

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-08-28
- **Deciders**: MemoryDB maintainers

## Context

ADR-0056 requires OpenCypher. We need a parser that can grow with TCK
scenarios, emit useful errors, and stay a small dependency. Official
openCypher publishes ANTLR, EBNF, and ISO BNF grammars.

## Decision

`memorydb-parser` is a hand-written lexer plus recursive-descent parser
whose grammar follows the openCypher structure (clauses, patterns,
expressions with Cypher precedence). The AST is the input to
`memorydb-planner`. We do not vendor ANTLR or generate from the official
grammar in v1.

## Alternatives considered

- **pest** — fast to start, ugly for Cypher’s operator precedence, keywords
  vs identifiers, and `|` in relationship types. Rejected for v1 control
  over errors and TCK syntax failures.
- **lalrpop** — closer to a spec grammar, heavier build, harder error
  recovery. Rejected until the language surface is stable.
- **ANTLR runtime / generated parser** — Java-centric official grammar,
  extra runtime. Rejected for a lightweight Rust engine.
- **An existing Cypher crate as a black box** — unknown TCK alignment and
  license/maintenance risk. Rejected; we own the AST (ADR-0056).

## Consequences

- Parser bugs are fixed in-tree; grammar extensions are code, not a
  generator step.
- A later move to lalrpop/pest is a new ADR.
- SyntaxError TCK scenarios can map to parser error codes as we fill them in.
