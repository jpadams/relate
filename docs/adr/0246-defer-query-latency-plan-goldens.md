# ADR-0246: Defer the query-latency plan goldens

> Renamed from ADR-0229: the number collided with

## Context

ADR-0243 item 5 pins `EXPLAIN` of each graph-benchmark-ldbc query at SF0.1
in `workloads/gbl/plans/sf0.1/qNN.plan`, as "the noise-free check for
planner cliffs of the K98 kind": comma-joined MATCH parts run in an order
that starts from the wrong node, turning a millisecond query into seconds
or minutes (q19, q22, q27 at SF1 on 0.11.8 and 0.12.0).

Building the suite showed that `EXPLAIN` cannot see those cliffs. It
renders the logical plan clause by clause
(`cypherlite/cypherlite/src/explain.rs`, `describe_clause`): q19 explains
as

```text
1. MATCH (2 patterns) + WHERE filter
2. RETURN (2 items) + ORDER BY + LIMIT
```

The decisions that made K98 slow — the order the parts run in
(`cypherlite-planner` `order_patterns`), the node each part starts from and
its orientation (ADR-0218), and whether an index serves the start — are not
in that output. A golden of it would change only when a query's clause
structure changes, which never happens for a fixed query text. It would
pass through every regression it was meant to catch.

## Decision

1. **No plan goldens.** The query-latency suite does not pin `EXPLAIN`
   output. ADR-0243 item 5 is withdrawn; nothing under
   `workloads/gbl/plans/` is created, and there is no
   `QUERY_LATENCY_UPDATE`.
2. **Planner cliffs are caught by latency.** ADR-0245's per-query compare
   (p50 ≤ max(1.5 × envelope, envelope + 0.5 ms)) carries that job: a K98
   cliff is a 100× or larger slowdown, far outside the band. The
   correctness checks of the suite are the answers (ADR-0243 item 4),
   errors and timeouts.
3. **An `EXPLAIN` that shows the physical plan is out of scope** for this
   work (maintainer decision). If a later ADR makes `EXPLAIN` render the
   part order, start node and index choice, plan goldens can be
   reconsidered under a new ADR.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep the goldens on the current `EXPLAIN`** — rejected: they would
  look like a planner gate while checking only clause structure, which a
  fixed query text never changes.
- **Extend `EXPLAIN` to the physical plan first, then pin it** —
  rejected for this work (maintainer decision): it changes a public
  surface across the engine and every client, with its own ADR and
  documentation, well beyond a test suite.
- **Pin a private planner dump** (an internal debug rendering of the
  ordered parts) — rejected: it would make a test crate depend on planner
  internals that the R1-R3 boundaries keep private, and freeze an
  undocumented format.

## Consequences

- ADR-0243 and ADR-0245 carry **Later references** notes naming this ADR;
  their mentions of plan goldens no longer apply.
- A plan change that does not move latency beyond the band goes
  unnoticed by the suite. That is accepted: the suite gates latency, not
  plan shape.
- The 19 weak SF0.1 answers (ADR-0243 Consequences) now rest on the SF1
  answers, run locally, and on the latency gate.

## Later references

- ADR-0247: SF0.1 runs 14 queries with literal substitutions, so the
  weak SF0.1 answers this ADR's Consequences mention are down to the five
  negative checks upstream also has at SF1; the SF0.1 answers carry
  correctness weight again.
